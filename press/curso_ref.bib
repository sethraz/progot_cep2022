Abstract = {When Spatial Analysis was published in 1968, it drew together the fruits of the first decade of geography's quantitative revolution. In the decades that have followed, quantitative geography has both diffused and concentrated, abandoned some themes, made major progress on others, and in the contemporary form of geospatial analysis has become an innovative multidisciplinary enterprise. In this article, we sketch the broad outlines of this history, lay out the main threads along which technical capabilities have developed, and describe what appear to us to be the leading questions at the research frontier. Even as many geographers disavow social science, geospatial science has emerged as a lusty arena marked by intellectual vigor, conceptual growth, and enhanced analytic abilities. What now is taking shape is a spatially integrated social–environmental science that is transcending older disciplinary attachments, boundaries, and constraints. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {Geostatistics is a distinctive methodology within the field of spatial statistics. In the past, it has been linked to particular problems (e.g., spatial interpolation by kriging) and types of spatial data (attributes defined on continuous space). It has been used more by physical than human geographers because of the nature of their types of data. The approach taken by geostatisticians has several features that distinguish it from the methods typically used by human geographers for analyzing spatial variation associated with regional data, and we discuss these. Geostatisticians attach much importance to estimating and modeling the variogram to explore and analyze spatial variation because of the insight it provides. This article identifies the benefits of geostatistics, reviews its uses, and examines some of the recent developments that make it valuable for the analysis of data on areal supports across a wide range of problems.

Abstract = {One of the shortcomings of quantitative methods in human geography is an overreliance on models that can only account for the average outcomes of spatial events. Although methodological advancements in the form of multilevel models now allow human geographers to account for average outcomes as well as deviations about average outcomes of spatial events, it is not without question that such models can fully account for the cultural, political, and social contexts that affect human behavior. In this article I argue for the adoption of a multilevel approach to the study of human behavior to address some of the criticisms of quantitative methods in human geography. Using a transportation geography research agenda as an example, I discuss how a multilevel approach can complement qualitative methods. Such mixed research methods offer human geographers the opportunity to identify the appropriate role for quantitative methods and explore how context affects behavior. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM },

abstract = {Abstract. Spatial pattern analysis based on Ripley's K-function is a second-order analysis of point patterns in a twodimensional space. The method is increasingly used in studies of spatial distribution patterns of plant communities, but the statistical methods involved are sometimes poorly understood or have been modified without evaluating the effects on results. The procedures of field data acquisition, statistical analysis, and the test for the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness are described and the presentation of results is discussed. Different methods of edge correction were tested on a computer-generated random pattern and a mapped distribution of a Mediterranean shrubland. The inclusion of buffer zones around mapped plots describes the spatial pattern most accurately, but may not warrant the additional labour involved. Three variations of the weighted edge correction yielded comparable results for the distribution patterns tested. The toroidal edge correction may give biased results for non-random patterns. Recommendations for standardisation of the statistical procedures and data presentation are given.},

abstract = {Many disciplines have influenced the representation of spatial data, both in analogue and digital forms. Surveyors, navigators, and military and civil en-gineers refined the fundamental concepts of mathematical geography, estab-lished often centuries ago by some of the founders of science, for example by al-Khw¯ arizm¯ ı. Digital representations came into being for practical reasons in computational geometry, in computer graphics and hardware-supported gaming, and in computer-assisted design and virtual reality. The use of spa-tial data as a business vehicle has been spurred early in the present century by consumer wired and mobile broadband penetration and distributed server farms, with examples being Google Earth™, Google Maps™, and others. There are often interactions between the graphics hardware required and the services offered, in particular for the fast rendering of scene views. In addition, space and other airborne technologies have vastly increased the volumes and kinds of spatial data available. Remote sensing satellites continue to make great contributions to earth observation, with multi-spectral images supplementing visible wavelengths. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000 has provided elevation data for much of the earth. Other satellite-borne sensor technologies are now vital for timely storm warnings, amongst other things. These complement terrestrial networks monitoring, for example, lightning strikes and the movement of precipitation systems by radar. Surveying in the field has largely been replaced by aerial photogram-metry, mapping using air photographs usually exposed in pairs of stereo images. Legacy aerial photogrammetry worked with analogue images, and many research laboratories and mapping agencies have large archives of air photographs with coverage beginning from the 1930s. These images can be scanned to provide a digital representation at chosen resolutions.},

 abstract = {Motivated by the current debate on possible raised incidence of certain types of cancers near nuclear installations, this paper develops a methodology for fitting a class of inhomogeneous Poisson point process models to data consisting of the locations of all occurrences of some phenomenon of interest within a designated planar region. The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the intensity function, with separate terms to describe natural spatial variation in intensity and possible raised incidence around a prespecified point. A nonparametric kernel smoothing approach, based on data from a related phenomenon, is used to describe natural spatial variation, while a parametric maximum likelihood approach is used to describe raised incidence near the prespecified point. The methodology is applied to data on the spatial distribution of cancers of the larynx and of the lung in the Chorley-Ribble area of Lancashire, England.},
